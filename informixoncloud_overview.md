# About Informix on Cloud


As a hosted offering, IBM® Informix® on Cloud for IBM Cloud provides you Informix pre-configured on a machine in a SoftLayer data center of your choice. After the machine is made available to you, you have complete control over it in the same way you would an
Informix system in your data center or office.
{: shortdesc}
You have the power and responsibility to administer the system according to your business needs, which includes:
<ul>
<li>Providing user access to the machine by sharing the internet address, user name, and password
and creating new connection credentials.</li>
<li>Maintaining software firewalls.</li>
<li>Maintaining the software platform - including IBM Informix and the operating system - to meet
your security standards.</li>
<li>Creating and maintaining all backups.</li>
<li>Developing programs or applications that interact with the Informix database. You are
responsible for the quality and performance of programs and applications that you develop.</li>
<li>Configuring programs or applications to connect with Informix.</li>
<li>Creating and maintaining any high availability configurations.</li>
<li>Monitoring and reporting any issues that you encounter with Informix to IBM.</li>
</ul>

## Available configurations
IBM Informix on Cloud for IBM Cloud servers for the small, medium, and large plan are virtual servers with dedicated CPUs, and the extra-large plan is a bare metal machine.
{: shortdesc}
The physical storage includes a smaller (100 GB minimum) disk for the operating system and a
larger disk for data (mounted at `/data`). Larger plans feature SSDs to further speed-up
transactions.
