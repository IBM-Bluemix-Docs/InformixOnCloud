If you would like to register by contacting an IBM sales representative, use the following guidelines:
1. After logging in to IBM Cloud, select IBM Informix on Cloud from the catalog tab. Select from the last four plans that are listed which read Contact IBM Sales and click **REQUEST**.
The currently supported plans are Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large. The Extra Large plan is a bare metal system. The Small, Medium, and Large plans are on a virtual machine.
A page then appears, displaying a detailed summary about your chosen plan. If you have a trial IBM Cloud account, you can expect a message that outlines the details about your trial. Review this information.
2. Provide any additional comments that you have, then click **SEND** to place your order.
After you place your order, a confirmation email with the selected plan information is sent to you.
3. Confirm your order.
When the system is ready, a welcome email with the information about accessing the system is sent to you.


If you would like to register by using your credit card directly without contacting an IBM sales representative, use the following the guidelines:
1. After logging in to IBM Cloud, select **IBM Informix on Cloud** from the catalog tab. Set your Datacenter location from the available dropdown menu. Select one of the four plans that are listed which do not read `Contact IBM Sales` and click **CREATE**.
The currently supported plans are Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large. The Extra Large plan is a bare metal system. The Small, Medium, and Large plans are on a virtual machine.
A page then appears, displaying a detailed summary about your chosen plan. If you have a trial IBM Cloud account, you can expect a message that outlines the details about your trial. Review this information.
2. When the system is ready, it will be indicated as such in the list of services on the IBM Cloud console. From this point, information about accessing the system can then be obtained in either of two ways:
  - In the IBM Cloud console, create a connection between the ready Informix on Cloud service instance and any application, and then view the application’s “informix_on_cloud” environment variable.
  - Wait for the welcome email.
